    "R follows the [Unix philosophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write programs that do one thing and do it well (modularity)\n",
    "* Write programs that work together (cohesiveness)\n",

    "* R, like it's inspiration, Scheme, is a _functional_ programming language\n",
    "* R evaluates lazily, delaying evaluation until necessary, which can make it very flexible\n",
    "* R is a highly interpreted dynamically typed language, allowing you to mutate variables and analyze datasets quickly, but is significantly slower than low-level, statically typed languages like C or Java\n",
    "* R has a high memory footprint, and can easily lead to crashes if you aren't careful\n",
