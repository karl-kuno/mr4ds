Student Resources
=================

This directory contains the Labs and modules from the course.

1. The rendered course materials can be found in the [handouts](https://github.com/Azure/mr4ds/tree/master/Student-Resources/Handouts) folder.
	- there is an html file, md file, and pdf file for each module.
	- you can click and view the md file directly in your browser.
2. The raw `.rmd` source files can be found in the [rmarkdown](https://github.com/Azure/mr4ds/tree/master/Student-Resources/rmarkdown) folder.
3. If you'd rather use jupyter notebooks, you can find those in the [notebooks](https://github.com/Azure/mr4ds/tree/master/Student-Resources/notebooks) folder.
	- the jupyter notebooks and rmarkdown are identical. Just different formats.
4. The labs are in the [labs](https://github.com/Azure/mr4ds/tree/master/Student-Resources/Labs) folder.
